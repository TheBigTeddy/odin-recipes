        <h2>Description</h2>i
        <p>Buttermilk Pancakes are an all time favourite recipe of mine, 
            and something my Girlfriend loves to have on mornings out!</p>
        <p>Hopefully, she is reading this in the future, as we make the pancakes together.<br>
            I love you so much, and cannot wait to spend more time together!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups Plain Flour</li>
            <li>4 tsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1 3/4 Cups Milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Essence</li>
            <li>4 tsp Butter <i>For Cooking</i></li>
            <li>Sugar Free Maple Syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl, whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add egg, milk and vanilla. Whisk until lump free, no longer than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Heat a non stick skillet , use medium heat if you have a strong stove,<br>
                medium high if you have a weak one. Add a tiny bit of butter (about 1/2 tsp)<br>
                swirl to melt. Use paper towel to mostly wipe the butter off<br>
                (this is the trick to avoid a dodgy 1st pancake).</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup batter into the middle of the fry pan (I use a slightly heaped<br>
                ice cream scoop with lever, standard is 1/4 cup).</li>
            <li>Swirl pan lightly to spread or use the ice cream scoop edge to spread into 11cm circle.</li>
            <li>When bubbles rise to the surface, flip and cook the other side until golden.</li>
            <li>Use more butter every 2 to 3 pancakes, depends how good your non stick coating is.</li>
            <li>Serve with berries for Girlfriend and Sugar-Free Maple Syrup.</li>
        </ol>
